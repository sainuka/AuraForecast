- Placement: Center of dashboard before OAuth connection
- Style: Simple line art illustration of health tracking devices in brand purple

- NO distracting scroll animations or unnecessary motion

## Key UX Patterns

- **Authentication Flow**: Clean centered auth forms with Supabase integration, welcoming copy
